# MLAI FSP Primer

[Schedule](https://gitlab.com/mlai-csiro/primer/wikis/home)

Online material for the course
- Machine Learning slides ([11.pdf](./11.pdf) [12.pdf](./13.pdf))
- Machine Learning tutorial ([11.ypynb](./11.ypynb) [12.ypynb](./13.ypynb))
- Computer Vision slides ([21.pdf](./21.pdf))
- Computer Vision tutorial ([21.ypynb](./21.ypynb))

We are offering a one day course providing insights into the areas of 
Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV). The purpose is for everyone to 
gain an understanding of the concepts, what kind of problems can be addressed, 
as well as some hands-on experience using people's own laptop computers to try 
a few  examples. Afterwards, the hope is that the participants are better 
positioned to understand where AIML can have an impact in their domains, as 
well as more efficiently discuss these topics with AIML domain experts.
 
The intent is that this course will be run a few times for those that have a 
direct interest contributing in-kind to the AIML FSP, and this instance is a 
beta version to get feedback on the material. Also, this time it will not 
be provided via WebEx, but will cater for ~15 people on site 
in Synergy/Canberra.

After this course you will better understand where ML can 
help scientific discovery, and where not. You will have seen a number of 
problem settings and techniques to find solutions for those problems. 
Having been exposed to the thinking and vocabulary of ML, you will be 
empowered to start a deeper conversation with ML domain experts in order 
to find out where ML might be of benefit for your scientific work. Similarly, 
you will have gained an understanding of what kinds of problems can be 
addressed in CV as well as tried your hand on some of them.
